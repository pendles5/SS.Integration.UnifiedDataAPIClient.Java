In order to run the integration test a docker container must be created with RabbitMQ.
This will then be run inside a VM to provide MQ services.


============================================================
SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

In order to set up your environment follow these steps (ignore steps 1 & 2 if vagrant is already available):

  1) install virtual box:
          https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
  2) install install-vagrant-on-windows-7
          http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
  3) install git
          http://git-scm.com/downloads
  4) install docker
          git clone https://github.com/dotcloud/docker.git
          



Now configure the environment by issuing the following commands within the docker directory,
these are only needed following a fresh installation:

    vagrant up
    vagrant halt    # to clear out some gunk
    vagrant up

         
         
            
Copy the file:
    "initRabbitMq.sh"
from this package into the vagrant's home directory, and issue the command:
    chmod 744 initRabbitMq.sh
while logged onto vagrant copy the file:
    "Dockerfile"
in this package and issue the command:

    sudo docker build -t sporting/rabbitmq .
    
to create the container we will use from now on as our test instance of rabbitmq.



    
    
    
    

============================================================
TESTING ENVIRONMENT 

These steps need to be carried out everytime to start up the VM and allow connectivity to RabbitMQ services,
presumably within the build system

    1) set up portforward:  vm:5672 -> host_running_tests:5672
    2) set up portforward:  vm:15672 -> host_running_tests:15672
    3) bring up the Vm with this command (if it's not already running)
            vagrant up
    4) then bring up the docker container which hosts activeMQ with this command
            docker run -d -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 sporting/rabbitmq
    5) now issue the command
            .\initRabbitMq.sh
       to create the users and vhost for the integration tests.
